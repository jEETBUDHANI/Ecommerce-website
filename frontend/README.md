# Ecommerce-website
“I developed a frontend-only E-Commerce website using ReactJS. The project aimed to create a dynamic UI where users can browse products, search, filter, and simulate adding items to a cart—all without a backend. I implemented these features using state management, JavaScript functions, and local UI updates.
